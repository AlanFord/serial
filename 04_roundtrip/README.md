# Round Trip Example

Note that at this time the example does not work on an Arduino Uno for some unknown reason.  The sketch works perfectly on the Nucleo board, indicating some compatibility with the Arduino Uno hardware.  One possible (but untested) solumtion would be to use the pySerialTransfer python package with the associated SerialTransfer.h header for the Arduino.  More information can be found at
